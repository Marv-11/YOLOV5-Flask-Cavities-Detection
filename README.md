# Revolutionizing Dental Care: A Deep Learning Approach to Caries Detection 

## Introduction
Welcome to the Revolutionizing Dental Care project! This innovative endeavor aims to leverage deep learning techniques, specifically the YOLOv5 model, to detect dental caries in both X-ray and colored images. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, we strive to enhance dental diagnostics and improve patient care.

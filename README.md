
Revolutionizing Dental Care: A Deep Learning Approach to Caries Detection

This project aims to utilize deep learning, specifically the YOLOv5 model, to detect dental caries in X-ray and colored images. This model has been trained on a dataset containing various dental images and then deployed as a web application using Flask.
